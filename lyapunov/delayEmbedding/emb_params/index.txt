Implementation of the method described in
	"A Differential Entropy Based Method for Determining the
	Optimal Embedding Parameters of a Signal"
by Gautama, T., Mandic, D.P. and Van Hulle, M.M. (2003), published in the
Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing
(ICASSP 2003) (icassp_gautama.ps.gz)

Note that there was an error in Eq. 3 in the original paper (corrected in
icassp_gautama.ps.gz).
